# DTOneAPIs

This package is an extension to the current Graphql queries that we use.
As the DTOne schema has classes whose name is similar to the class name in our older schema, and 2 same class name cannot be present in a same file, so we extended the DTOne schema file in to a package so that we can use both of them independently
